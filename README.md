## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that variables like "Prosper Rating", Stated Monthly Income, "Verifiable Income" and the Loan Amount influences the Borrower's APR.

Looking at the ratings specifically, we saw that borrowers with the lowerest rating(HR) received higher APR, and borrower with high rating A(A) received lowers APR. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on variables that influences Borrower APR, such as; Prosper Rating", Stated Monthly Income, "Verifiable Income" and the Loan Amount.
